## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a number of challenges while working on our project. At first, we planned out everything we were going to do, but later realized that it was not as easy at it seemed. It was hard to adapt into our newly formed team and a lot of schedule-clashes. We also enrolled in a few other technical events, which really reduced our breathing time. But in hindsight, we learnt that one can unleash their actual potential only in times like like these. Working on this project taught us time management, consistency and teamwork.
